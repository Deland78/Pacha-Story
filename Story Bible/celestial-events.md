# Celestial Events Reference

## Ancient Period (Tiwanaku)
- **Comet Over Tiwanaku (992 CE)** - Witnessed by Khunu during the Elder's burial ritual. The comet's tail serves as warning and omen, marking the beginning of crisis as the raised fields fail and Lake Titicaca recedes. The three Pachas converge in this moment of cosmic display and ancestral passage.

## Chasqui Timeline
- **Halley's Comet Anticipation (1452)** - Young chasqui hears astronomer-priests forecast the comet's next appearance, embedding expectation and ritual preparation into his early routes.
- **Annular Solar Eclipse (1492)** - Path arcs across present-day Costa Rica, Panama, Colombia, and Brazil; unseen by the chasqui but revealed to the reader as a hidden sign that the world is turning.
- **Halley's Comet Return (1531)** - Visible across the Southern Hemisphere; the aged chasqui witnesses it over Chucuito, reading it as the long-awaited *pachakuti* omen amid smallpox and civil war murmurs.

## Modern Period
- **Meteor Shower Over Tiwanaku (1992)** - Dr. Carlos Mamani and his family witness an intense meteor shower from the Akapana Pyramid excavation site. During the climactic moment when ten meteors cross the sky simultaneously, Carlos experiences pachakuti—a temporal folding where he sees Lake Titicaca at its ancient shoreline lapping against the pyramid's base. The meteor shower functions as a celestial echo of the 992 CE comet witnessed by Khunu, connecting the two moments of cosmic display across exactly one millennium. Carlos's daughters Maya and Cusi experience pure wonder while their father perceives the deeper connection through ancestral memory.

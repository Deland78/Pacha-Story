# Celestial Events Reference

## Ancient Period (Tiwanaku)
- **Comet Over Tiwanaku (989 CE)** - Witnessed by Khunu three years before the Elder's burial ritual. The comet's tail serves as warning and omen, marking the beginning of crisis as the raised fields fail and Lake Titicaca recedes. During the Elder's burial in 992 CE, Khunu's memory of this cosmic event connects the moment to ancestral passage and the convergence of the three Pachas.

## Chasqui Timeline
- **Halley's Comet Anticipation (1452)** - The chasqui is born during this period of intense anticipation. Astronomer-priests forecast the comet's imminent appearance, and this expectation and ritual preparation becomes woven into the cultural moment of his birth, shaping his early understanding of cosmic cycles.
- **Annular Solar Eclipse (1492)** - Path arcs across present-day Costa Rica, Panama, Colombia, and Brazil; unseen by the chasqui but revealed to the reader as a hidden sign that the world is turning.
- **Halley's Comet Return (1531)** - Visible across the Southern Hemisphere; the aged chasqui witnesses it over Chucuito, reading it as the long-awaited *pachakuti* omen amid smallpox and civil war murmurs.

## Modern Period
- **Halley's Comet (1986)** - A celestial event witnessed by Dr. Carlos Mamani and his wife six years prior. This shared memory becomes a touchstone for understanding the cycles of cosmic display.
- **Meteor Shower Over Tiwanaku (1992)** - Dr. Carlos Mamani and his family witness an intense meteor shower from the Akapana Pyramid excavation site. As they stargaze with their daughters Maya and Cusi, Carlos and his wife recall their memory of witnessing Halley's Comet in 1986. During the climactic moment when ten meteors cross the sky simultaneously, Carlos experiences pachakuti—a temporal folding where he sees Lake Titicaca at its ancient shoreline lapping against the pyramid's base. The meteor shower functions as a celestial echo of both the 1986 comet they remember and the 992 CE comet witnessed by Khunu, connecting these moments of cosmic display across centuries. Through the lens of their shared memory, Carlos perceives that his family has become part of a lineage of cosmic witnesses.

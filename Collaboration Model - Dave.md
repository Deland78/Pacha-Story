### **Chosen AI Architecture**

**Hybrid Reviewer Loop**

- AI runs early factual/voice checks → Authors review weekly → AI mediates unresolved disagreements with logic/pacing/reader-impact analysis → Partners decide jointly.

---

### **Risks & Mitigations**

- **Risk:** Accountability (“creator fixes”) may slow iteration.**Mitigation:** Use AI factual pre-checks to reduce issue volume.
- **Risk:** AI voice uniformity could flatten stylistic diversity.**Mitigation:** Human final stylist maintains dynamic rhythm.
- **Risk:** Tie-breaking by AI could mask subtle emotional beats.**Mitigation:** Partners always co-review AI reasoning.

# Pacha Story HQ Workspace Wiki

This workspace mirrors the planned Notion hub so we can draft, track, and refine the *Pacha* story cycle even before the digital workspace is live. Every folder has a clear role to keep context organized and to support AI collaboration.

## Root Contents

- `AI Collaboration Guidelines.md`: Operational rules for briefing AI, chunking drafts, and reviewing outputs. Keep this visible whenever you or an AI tool starts new work.
- `story-summary.md`: Existing concept outline for the project. Use it as a quick reference for the core idea until a fuller story bible is in place.

## Folder Guide

### Cord Board
Holds planning notes for each cord/timeline section. Store status trackers, outline drafts, and exportable summaries (e.g., CSV or markdown tables) so you can mirror the eventual Notion kanban.

### Scene Drafts
Primary home for scene-level writing. Each scene gets its own markdown document. Subfolder `Scene Drafts/templates` keeps reusable prompt checklists, emotional beat worksheets, or first-draft skeletons. This separation helps the AI receive the right context before drafting.

### Characters & Artifacts
Profiles for characters, cultural symbols, and key objects (like the Staff God). Include backstory, emotional arcs, motif links, and cross-timeline notes. Having these nearby prevents AI drift on character traits when context windows reset.

### Research Library
Store reference materials—summaries, citations, PDFs, or extracted notes. Tag files or prefix filenames (`HIST_`, `COSMO_`) so you can quickly cite sources during drafting and ensure AI-generated details stay grounded.

### Sprint Log
Weekly or bi-weekly planning notes. Add agendas, goals, and outcomes for each collaboration session. These logs provide the recap material needed for AI prompts and help both writers stay aligned on pacing.

### Changelog & Decisions
Record major creative choices, retcons, and unresolved questions. Keep one markdown file per decision batch or date. This log becomes the authoritative memory that AI can reference when it risks contradicting earlier choices.

### AI Collaboration Hub
Archive of prompts and outputs. Save the prompt, the AI response, and a short verdict (`accepted`, `needs revision`, `discarded`). This forms a learning loop: future prompts can reference what worked and what to avoid.

### Story Bible
Consolidated reference material—condensed timeline, glossary, tone notes, and motif tracker. As sections solidify, move key info from `story-summary.md` here. It is the master document you’ll feed into AI as concise briefs.

### Visual Quipu Builder
Sketches, diagrams, or notes for the quipu-inspired structure. Drop images, ASCII diagrams, or drafting notes that describe how cords interlock. Visual cues keep the narrative architecture front of mind.

### Feedback Archive
Meeting notes, margin comment exports, or voice memo transcripts. Organizing feedback separately keeps draft folders clean while still giving AI-accessible context for revisions.

## Usage Tips

- When a scene or cord stabilizes, add its recap to `Story Bible` and log the decision in `Changelog & Decisions`.
- Before any AI request, review `AI Collaboration Guidelines.md` and pull the relevant recap from `Scene Drafts` or `Story Bible`.
- Use ISO-date suffixes on files (`Scene3-2024-06-18.md`) to make version history and handoffs explicit.
- Once Notion is ready, you can migrate each folder’s content into the corresponding database while preserving naming conventions.

  Actual historical location on southeastern shore of Lake Titicaca, in Collasuyu (southern quarter
  of Tawantinsuyu). Center of Aymara-speaking community organized in ayllus. During Inca civil war,
  region aligned with Huáscar; after Atahualpa's victory, local elites found themselves on losing side.
  Chucuito represents the permanence of place against the impermanence of empire—Tiwanaku collapsed,
  Inca will collapse, Spanish will come, but Chucuito endures as dwelling place, as community, as
  particular location on sacred geography. The Chasqui's dwelling in Chucuito becomes threshold space
  where interior (deathbed) meets exterior (mountains, sky, comet), where kay pacha meets ukhu pacha,
  where personal passage mirrors imperial collapse. The town itself is a presence—neither backdrop
  nor setting, but witness with its own memory stretching back through Tiwanaku times.

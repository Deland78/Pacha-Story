  The raised-field landscapes (waru-waru in Quechua, suka kollu in Aymara) that lace the flat pampas around Lake Titicaca
  embody the coupling of cosmology and agronomy. Built as linear platforms separated by canals, they buffered frost,
  stored heat, and conserved water, making high-altitude farming more reliable and productive. These fields were agricultural
  infrastructure and cosmological maps, inscribing ordered water and earth on a landscape where Pachamama and sky demanded reciprocity.

  Archaeologists and agronomists (particularly Clark Erickson and collaborators) working in the basin before 1992 documented
  the extent of raised fields and reconstructed them in experimental plots — dramatically improving yields of potatoes,
  quinoa, and tubers. Field experiments reframed ancient fields not as relics but as viable technologies whose engineering
  and scale are beyond dispute.

  Tiwanaku's economy depended on agropastoral risk management: communities relied on raised fields, herding, vertical access
  to ecological tiers, and shared labor to manage the extreme altiplano conditions. Frost and hydrology shaped everything —
  waru-waru mitigated cold, canals trapped heat. The maintenance of these fields required constant reciprocal labor: shared
  canal cleaning, ritual timing of planting, communal feasts. When abandoned or neglected, they fail.

  By 992 CE, the suka kollus represented the mature Tiwanaku achievement: engineered earth made sacred, labor made prayer,
  and abundance made possible through the lived covenant between humans and Pachamama. In the scene, their failure and the
  choking of channels with silt and silence signals the breaking of that covenant—a visible sign of Pacha's folding.

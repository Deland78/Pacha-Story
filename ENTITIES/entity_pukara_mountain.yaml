  Pukara means 'fortress' in Aymara. Pukara was revered as a protector of the Tiwanaku heartland near Lake Titicaca.
  Apu Pukara was not only a mountain but a living guardian — a point where earth and sky met, where the Tiwanaku people
  sought dialogue with the sacred forces that sustained life on the Altiplano. In 992 CE the Tiwanaku civilization was
  in decline or approaching rapid decline. Core samples from Lake Titicaca suggest that a period of severe drought had
  started to set in, coming into full effect during the 11th century CE. Some studies believe that political upheaval
  occurred prior to this climactic shift. Pukara represents the protector of Tiwanaku who was not respected during this
  period of political upheaval and played a role in the climate shift that came after.

notes: >
  Born ~1453 near Lake Titicaca. Vigorous chasqui messenger in youth (1492 journey to Cusco and Isla Del Sol).
  Earned wisdom and favor through service, became ayllu leader in Chucuito. His chasqui fitness extended his
  life to ~79 years. Dies in late 1532 witnessing both the 1532 comet and the collapse of Tawantinsuyu.
  Represents the witness who becomes threshold—like Khunu in W01, he experiences pachakuti at the intersection
  of cosmic event and personal transformation. Unnamed to maintain archetypal quality, connecting him to
  "The Elder" in W01. His death mirrors the empire's death; his passage to Ukhu Pacha occurs as Tawantinsuyu
  fragments. Three generations of chasquis (father-son-grandson) embody the continuation of message-carrying
  even as empire dissolves.

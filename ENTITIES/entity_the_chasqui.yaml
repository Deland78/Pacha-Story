  Named Nayra, Aymara for "he who sees"—fitting for one who becomes witness and threshold. Born 1452 near 
  Lake Titicaca. Vigorous chasqui messenger in youth (1492 journey to Cusco and Isla Del Sol, age 40).
  Earned wisdom and favor through service, became ayllu leader in Chucuito. His chasqui fitness extended his
  life to 80 years. Dies in late 1532 witnessing both the 1532 comet and the collapse of Tawantinsuyu.
  Represents the witness who becomes threshold—like Khunu in W01, he experiences pachakuti at the intersection
  of cosmic event and personal transformation. His name's meaning ("he who sees") reflects his role across
  all three weavings: seeing the impossible news (W03), seeing the pattern of empire's mortality (W04), and
  seeing the comet at death as he passes to Ukhu Pacha (W05). His death mirrors the empire's death; his passage
  occurs as Tawantinsuyu fragments. Three generations of chasquis (father-son-grandson) embody the continuation 
  of message-carrying even as empire dissolves.

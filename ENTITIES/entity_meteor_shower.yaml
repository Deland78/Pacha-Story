notes: >
  The 1992 meteor shower functions as a celestial echo of the comet witnessed by Khunu in 992 CE (W01).
  Both cosmic displays mark moments of pachakuti—temporal folding where past and present become
  simultaneously visible. The climactic moment when ten meteors cross the sky simultaneously triggers
  Carlos's vision of the ancient lake, suggesting certain cosmic patterns create thresholds in Pacha's
  fabric. The meteor shower sings where the comet warned—different tonalities of the same message
  from Hanan Pacha. The daughters count and compete to spot meteors, experiencing wonder without
  knowing they witness a cosmic anniversary of their ancestor Khunu's vigil a millennium prior.

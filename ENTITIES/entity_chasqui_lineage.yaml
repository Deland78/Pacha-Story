entity_id: chasqui_lineage
name: "The Messenger Lineage"
domain: kay
essence: "Three generations carrying messages through imperio's collapse"
relations:
  - The Chasqui (elder, dying)
  - His Son (middle generation)
  - His Grandson (youngest runner)
  - The Chasqui Network
  - Tawantinsuyu
appears_through: "Footsteps arriving breathless, news spoken with runner's rhythm, three voices across time"
material_presence: "Weathered legs, messenger's breath, quipu cords passing from hand to hand"
notes: >
  Rather than creating separate entities for Son and Grandson, this entity represents the generational
  thread of message-carriers. The grandfather (The Chasqui) dies in W03-W05; his son performs deathbed
  rituals and carries news; his grandson arrives breathless with impossible reports. The lineage continues
  even as empire doesn't. All three are chasquis, embodying different relationships to the same role:
  elder who built the network, middle generation witnessing its breakdown, youth who will carry messages
  in a transformed world. Represents continuity through transformation—the pattern persists even when
  the empire it served dissolves.

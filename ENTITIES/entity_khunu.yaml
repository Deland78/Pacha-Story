  Khunu is Aymara for snowfall. Snow (khunu) is the purest form of water, untouched by the world below.
  As a name, Khunu signifies: Purity of heart or spirit, Integrity—someone untouched by corruption,
  Clarity and calm. Khunu is a minor character meant to give the scene a presence. He is not a figure
  of major significance—simply an observer whose consciousness brings the reader into the threshold
  of the three Pachas as a witness from the Tiwanaku perspective.

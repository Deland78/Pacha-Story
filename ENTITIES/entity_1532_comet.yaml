  - 1992 Meteor Shower (future echo)
  - Tawantinsuyu (marks its ending)
appears_through: "Blazing tail across Andean night, light on mountains, comet-fire reflected in dying eyes"
material_presence: "Light, celestial fire, the night sky's pronouncement"
notes: >
  Historically called "Atahualpa's Comet," appeared March-April 1532. In the story, through magical realism
  aligned with pacha's temporal folding, this comet appears/returns at the moment of the Chasqui's death
  in late 1532 (Option C from the plan). This allows both historical completeness (news of Cajamarca in
  November 1532) and symbolic power (comet present at death). The comet is THE singular present-tense
  celestial event across all timelines: 992 comet is remembered in present by Khunu, 1531 Halley's is
  remembered by dying Chasqui, 1992 meteor shower is present for Carlos, but ONLY this 1532 comet is
  both historically present AND visually/spiritually present at the moment of transformation. It marks
  pachakuti—the world-turning when personal, imperial, and cosmic death synchronize. The comet is not
  just omen but witness, not just warning but messenger, speaking the language of Hanan Pacha directly
  into kay and ukhu pacha.

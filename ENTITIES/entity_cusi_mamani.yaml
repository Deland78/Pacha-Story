notes: >
  Cusi (meaning "joy" or "happiness" in Quechua) is the younger daughter (10 years old) who shows
  less interest in her father's archaeological lessons. She yawns, challenges ("But they cannot speak"),
  and prefers immediate physical experience (sleep on air mattress) to contemplation. However, she
  experiences the meteor shower with pure delight ("Ooooh! Did you see that one?"), suggesting her
  connection to Pacha is through joy and sensory wonder rather than intellectual understanding. Her
  presence represents a valid alternative relationship to ancestral knowledge—not every generation
  must become threshold-walkers. Some may simply live joyfully in Kay Pacha, carrying forward lineage
  through being rather than witnessing. The name "munaycha" (her pet-name, meaning "pretty/cute one")
  her father uses reveals his tender acceptance of who she is.

  The burial mound is a liminal space where the living world meets Ukhu Pacha. In Andean cosmology, death is not an ending
  but a transformation: the Elder descends into the earth not to disappear but to become an ancestor—a presence that continues
  to influence and protect the living.

  Burial itself is an act of reciprocity. By honoring and interring the dead with care, the living maintain the covenant (*ayni*)
  that binds them to their ancestors. In turn, the ancestors—now in Ukhu Pacha—guide, warn, and sustain the living through dreams,
  omens, and ancestral knowledge carried in memory and ritual.

  This mound will serve as a threshold in future scenes: a place where the boundary between realms grows thin, where the living
  may encounter ancestral presences, and where the ongoing dialogue between Kay Pacha and Ukhu Pacha continues to unfold.

  The mound embodies a core principle of pre-Columbian Andean life: that the dead are never truly gone, and that community includes
  both the living and the ancestors. Through continued ritual, offering, and remembrance, the living keep their ancestors alive, and
  the ancestors continue to weave themselves into the fabric of the living world.

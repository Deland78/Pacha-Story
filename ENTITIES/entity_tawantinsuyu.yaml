appears_through: "Fractured quipu cords, impossible news, civil war reports, the silencing of imperial voice"
material_presence: "Messages that no longer bind, roads that still run but carry dissolution, the absence of center"
notes: >
  The empire itself as presence, as entity experiencing death parallel to the Chasqui's personal death.
  Tawantinsuyu (Quechua: "The Four Parts Together") was bound through reciprocity, mit'a labor, road
  systems, and crucially the chasqui messenger network that allowed governance across vast distances.
  The Chasqui in his youth helped build/maintain this binding; in his death, he witnesses its unraveling.
  The empire's "death" begins with Huayna Capac's smallpox death (1527-28), accelerates through civil
  war (1529-32), and culminates with Atahualpa's capture at Cajamarca (Nov 1532). But the true dissolution
  is in the breakdown of reciprocity and communication—when messages carry impossible news, when trusted
  networks report unbelievable events, when the center cannot hold. Tawantinsuyu is not backdrop but
  dying presence, its breath synchronized with the Chasqui's failing breath. Yet like the Chasqui passing
  to Ukhu Pacha, the empire's dissolution is transformation, not erasure—Andean peoples, culture, sacred
  geography endure beyond political structure.

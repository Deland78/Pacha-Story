  The Elder is intentionally nameless and is a symbolic representation of Ukhu Pacha.
  In 992 CE, research suggests that the Tiwanaku had stopped practicing formal ritual burials.
  This burial would have been relatively simple and done in a village outside of the ritual center.
  Elders were seen as carriers of wisdom. This Elder would have interpreted the comet and known its meaning.
  In death, the Elder becomes a messenger between the living world and the ancestral realm, carrying
  the weight of the transformation from abundance to loss.

notes: >
  Jennifer is Carlos's wife, an artist who sketches the excavation sites. Though she does not
  experience the pachakuti vision directly, she possesses an intuitive awareness that allows her
  to sense when Carlos "leaves"—when his consciousness crosses temporal thresholds. Her gesture
  of weaving her fingers through his serves as an anchor, grounding him when he becomes lost in
  ancestral presence. She represents a different form of witnessing—not seeing but feeling, not
  knowing but trusting. Her role as mother and partner creates the family structure through which
  ancestral knowledge passes to the next generation.

  The Staff God as a Pacha Mediator:
  In Tiwanaku and earlier Chavín imagery, the Staff God stands at the axis of worlds — often between mirrored halves
  or in the center of a cosmogram. This positioning expresses the center of Pacha, the taypi or chawpi — the meeting place
  of Hanan Pacha (upper world of sky and deities), Kay Pacha (living world of humans and earth), and Ukhu Pacha (inner or
  underworld of ancestors and fertility). By standing upright, holding staffs that may symbolize dual cosmic powers
  (masculine–feminine, sun–rain, order–chaos), the Staff God acts as a bridge across all three Pachas.

  Embodiment of Cosmic Order and Renewal:
  In the Tiwanaku worldview, Pacha is not just space or time — it is the living fabric of cycles. The Staff God embodies
  the ordering principle that periodically restores balance when one Pacha overextends or falls into disorder (droughts,
  floods, societal collapse). Each renewal — like the rising of the sun at solstice or the re-emergence of rains — is a
  Pachacuti, a turning or world reversal. The Staff God presides over these transformations as the keeper of cosmic equilibrium.

  Pacha as Sacred Geography:
  At Tiwanaku, the Staff God's imagery is carved into the Gateway of the Sun, facing the solstice sunrise. This alignment
  links divine power with the rhythm of the landscape and celestial cycles — a living Pacha. Thus, he is not a "sky god"
  alone but a land-sky unifier: the sacred mountain (apu), the rain, the sun, and the subterranean waters all flow through
  him as parts of one Pacha-being.

  Continuity into Inca Thought:
  When the Inca later adopted and renamed this deity as Viracocha, they preserved his Pacha-bridging role. Viracocha was
  said to have emerged from Lake Titicaca (a liminal Pacha between land and sky) to bring form, order, and time itself into
  being — and then to vanish across the sea. His emergence and departure mark transitions in Pacha, the beginnings and
  endings of cosmic epochs. In 992 CE, the Staff God's presence in the textile worn by The Elder affirms that reciprocity
  and cosmic order must continue even as balance shifts toward transformation.

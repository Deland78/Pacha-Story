notes: >
  Maya is the elder daughter (13 years old) who shows growing receptivity to her father's teachings.
  Her statement "They are always speaking, right Papa?" reveals she is beginning to understand that
  ancestors communicate through material culture and cosmic events. Her usual teenage restraint
  dissolves into pure amazement during the meteor shower, suggesting her consciousness is opening
  to perceive Pacha's deeper layers. Her name connects her to the ancient Maya civilization, but
  also to "maya" in Sanskrit (illusion/appearance)—perhaps suggesting she will learn to see through
  surface appearances to underlying reality. She represents the continuation of witnessing across
  generations.

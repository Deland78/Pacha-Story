  The Akapana Pyramid is one of Tiwanaku's largest structures, a terraced temple platform that once
  stood at the ceremonial heart of the city. In the 1990s excavations, it yields elaborate textiles
  including the Staff God weaving that serves as a physical anchor connecting Carlos to Khunu's time.
  The pyramid's terraced levels mirror the three Pachas—ascending from Ukhu through Kay toward Hanan.
  During Carlos's pachakuti vision, he sees Lake Titicaca lapping at its base, revealing the pyramid's
  original relationship to water (now over 20km away). The pyramid holds memories in its soil—each
  layer a temporal stratum. Carlos's daughters play on its levels, unknowingly touching the same stones
  that witnessed the Elder's burial a thousand years before. Archaeological excavation becomes a form
  of ritual—carefully brushing away time to reveal what speaks beneath.

  For the Tiwanaku people (ca. 500–1000 CE), Lake Titicaca was not merely a body of water — it was the navel of the cosmos,
  the source of creation and the threshold between worlds. Tiwanaku mythic traditions — later echoed in Inca narratives — held
  that the first humans and deities emerged from the waters of Titicaca. From its depths rose Viracocha (The Staff God), the
  primordial creator, who formed the sun, moon, and stars before populating the earth. This mythic act of creation sanctified
  the entire region: the lake's islands, peninsulas, and shoreline temples became sacred stations in a cosmic geography where
  divine and human realms intertwined. In 992 CE, the lake's withdrawal signals not merely drought but a cosmic refusal—the
  navel of creation questioning its relationship with the living world.

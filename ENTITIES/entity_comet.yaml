  This comet is Halley's Comet. Astronomical records dating back to this time period show that it likely would have
  passed over the skies of Tiwanaku in the year 989 CE. Halley's Comet passes Earth approximately every 76 years,
  roughly the lifespan of a human. Pre-Inca civilizations would have had intimate knowledge of the patterns of the skies.
  Through ancestral worship and the passage of wisdom, they would have known and anticipated the comet's arrival.
  Other perihelion passages: 1456 CE, 1531 CE, 1986 CE. Its appearance in 989 CE was read by the Tiwanaku people as a sign
  of Pachacuti (the folding of Pacha) and triggered the political upheaval which preceded the climate shift that eventually
  led to the complete collapse of their civilization between 1000–1100 CE. For this scene, the comet serves as both
  prophecy and confirmation: the ancestors speak, and the living witness the unfolding of what was foretold.

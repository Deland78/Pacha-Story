notes: >
  Carlos is an archaeologist of Incan lineage excavating Tiwanaku sites in the 1990s. He carries both
  scientific rigor and deep reverence for his ancestors. His experience of pachakuti during the meteor
  shower reveals him as someone whose indigenous heritage allows him to perceive the folding of time
  when Pacha chooses to reveal itself. He teaches his daughters about reciprocity and the speaking of
  ancestors through material culture. His connection to Khunu across a thousand years suggests that
  certain individuals serve as witnesses across time—their consciousness creating continuity in Pacha's
  self-knowing.

# Next Steps Brief

1. Deliver `prompt-for-claude.md` to Claude so the Notion workspace and dashboard are created per the setup guides.
2. Review Claude’s setup and confirm connectors, approvals, and daily digest automation are operating as expected.
3. Migrate any remaining Google Drive content (additional research, assets) into the new Notion databases.
4. Draft the sprint kickoff plan in the `Sprint Log`, defining initial goals for each cord.
5. Outline scene beats for the five arcs, linking to the chasqui profile and celestial events references.
6. Identify emotional focus points for the first sprint and log them in the dashboard tracker.
7. Prepare AI prompt templates in the `Scene Drafts` database, ensuring they reference approval workflow and tone guidelines.
8. Schedule the first review checkpoint with your dad to align on process, responsibilities, and Notion usage.
9. Begin drafting the earliest scenes (likely 992 and 1992 vignettes) using the new workflow, logging AI outputs accordingly.
10. Update the changelog after each major decision to keep context synced across tools.

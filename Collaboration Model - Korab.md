# Collaboration Model - Korab

# ✅ Korab Final Profile — Collaborative Writing Partnership Summary

**Project:** Pacha Story HQ

**Last updated:** 2025-11-03

---

## Motivation & Goals

- Learning-focused partnership optimized for **learning > accountability > speed**.
- Multi-timeline storytelling with time-zone-friendly asynchronous workflow.
- Human strengths: through lines, description, plot, worldbuilding.
- AI compensates: dialogue naturalness, subtext, voice consistency.

---

## Preferred Collaboration Model(s)

**Model:** Outline-together + alternating scenes/chapters with AI-first drafting.

- **Two-Track Outline** — AI proposes beats → humans approve.
- **Reviewer Loop** — AI drafts → human critiques/revises; max 2 revision cycles.
- **Alternating POVs** with flexible ownership; cross-POV edits may remove but not add without beat reference.
- Weekly exchanges with 48-hour feedback SLA (1-week hard max).

**Optional modes enabled:**

- Character Ownership (scene ownership by character)
- Scene Auction (bid for preferred scenes)
- Mosaic Drafting (out-of-order assembly)

---

## Strengths & Champion Areas

- Structural logic and through-line consistency.
- Strong worldbuilding and descriptive detail.
- Process-oriented collaboration with clear ownership rules.
- Scene/chapter owner has final say; **one overrule per chapter** allowed.

## AI Roles + Human Gates (HITL %)

| Stage | AI Role | AI % | Human Gate |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Idea Generation** | Beat proposer | 50% | Human approves rationales |
| **Outlining** | Beat sheet creator | 75–90% | Human edits/locks outline after each chapter |
| **First Drafting** | Scene drafter | 90–100% | Human accepts/revises all edits |
| **Line Editing / Style** | Voice-match tester | 50–75% | Human approves diffs (≥85% match required) |
| **Continuity / Factual** | Timeline/canon auditor | 80–90% | Human signs off on tests |
| **Final Approval** | — | 0% | **100% human** (AI → Korab → Dad) |

**Definition of "done":** Three passes (AI → Korab → Dad), max 2 revision cycles. Chapter done only when whole book is polished.

---

## Chosen AI Architecture

**Hybrid: Two-Track Outline + Reviewer Loop**

- AI runs early drafts and continuity checks → Authors review weekly → AI provides voice/factual tests → Partners decide jointly.
- **Required Proof Pack per pass:**
    1. Source & Continuity Bundle (facts, timeline, canon references)
    2. Style Conformance Test (≥85% voice match target)
    3. Draft Diff + Rationale (what changed and why)
    4. Logic & Tension Tests (goal, conflict, turn, consequence, hook)

---

## Risks & Mitigations

- **Risk:** Voice drift with AI-heavy drafting.**Mitigation:** Style-Checker enforces ≥85% voice match; humans approve all diffs.
- **Risk:** Multi-timeline continuity breaks.**Mitigation:** Evaluator runs timeline tests per scene; human sign-off required.
- **Risk:** Over-planning slows momentum.**Mitigation:** Cap artifacts at 1 page; review after each chapter.
- **Risk:** Time-zone delays.**Mitigation:** Alternating-scene ownership; escalation after 1 week.

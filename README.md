# Pacha Story Collaborative Workspace

A structured field for human + AI co-writers building a Pacha-aligned narrative. Story units live as **Weavings** (YAML scenes), presences live as **Entities**, and their relations are tracked in a digital quipu (`KHIPU_MAP.yaml`) instead of a linear outline.

## 1. Purpose & Principles
- Embody Andean cosmology directly: hana (upper), kay (living), ukhu (inner/ancestral).
- Write relation-first: each weaving begins with a meeting of presences and ends on a transformed relation.
- Keep humans and AI synchronized through shared templates, indices, and automation.

## 2. Core Files & Folders
| Path | Why it matters |
| --- | --- |
| `AGENTS.md` | Authoritative guidance: vocabulary (Weavings, Entities, cords/knots), voice rules, how to add files, when to run scripts. |
| `KHIPU_MAP.yaml` | Digital quipu: domain colors, knot/cord vocab, current cords (Blood & River, Mountain & Child), autogenerated `entities_index` and `weavings_index`. |
| `WEAVINGS/` | YAML scenes (`W01_example.yaml`, `W02_example.yaml`, `W03.yaml`, `W04.yaml`, `W05.yaml`). Use `_TEMPLATE.yaml` when adding `W06` and beyond. |
| `ENTITIES/` | Presences (`entity_naira.yaml`, `entity_apu_qocha.yaml`, `entity_river_spirit.yaml`). Duplicate `_TEMPLATE.yaml` for new ones. |
| `update_khipu.py` + `.githooks/pre-commit` | Refresh `entities_index` and `weavings_index` whenever you add/edit Weavings or Entities. |
| Collaboration folders | `Scene Drafts/`, `Story Bible/`, `Research Library/`, `Sprint Log/`, `Feedback Archive/`, `Visual Quipu Builder/`, etc. Draft freely here, but canon lives in YAML. |

## 3. Workflow Snapshot
1. **Orient** – Read `AGENTS.md` and scan `KHIPU_MAP.yaml` to see active cords, knots, and domains.
2. **Plan a cord** – Decide which relationship thread (water, stone, reciprocity, lineage, dream, etc.) needs its next knot.
3. **Draft a Weaving** – Copy `_TEMPLATE.yaml` to `WEAVINGS/WNN.yaml`. Fill in meeting of presences, domain, threads continued, event form, transformation, symbolic motif.
4. **Update the quipu** – Under the relevant cord(s) in `KHIPU_MAP.yaml`, add a knot with `weaving_id`, `knot_type`, `transformation`, and any cross-domain `echoes` (e.g., `hana:W02`).
5. **Maintain Entities** – If a new presence appears, duplicate `ENTITIES/_TEMPLATE.yaml`, keep `entity_id` stable, and describe domain/essence/relations/material presence.
6. **Sync indices** – Run `python update_khipu.py` (or rely on the pre-commit hook) so `entities_index` and `weavings_index` stay accurate.
7. **Reflect** – Log what shifted between hana/kay/ukhu per the maintenance practice in `AGENTS.md`.

## 4. From Prose Draft to Canonical Weaving
- Use prose drafts (e.g., `Scene Drafts/tiwanaku_burial_scene.md`) to explore voice.
- When ready, translate into a Weaving:
  1. Create `WEAVINGS/W06.yaml` from `_TEMPLATE.yaml`.
  2. Set domain (e.g., `ukhu`), connect `threads_continued` (e.g., `kay:W01`, `hana:W02`), specify `event_form`, `transformation`, `symbolic_motif`.
  3. Mention all `entities_present`.
  4. Add a knot to an existing cord or start a new one (see Section 6).
  5. Include echoes so the moment vibrates across domains.

## 5. Entities (Presences)
- Duplicate `_TEMPLATE.yaml`, set `entity_id` (e.g., `entity_khunu.yaml`).
- Describe:
  - `domain` (hana/kay/ukhu).
  - `essence` (what they embody).
  - `relations` (reciprocities, obligations, kinships).
  - `material_presence` (stones, wind, textiles, gestures).
- Keep IDs and filenames stable; refer to display names (e.g., “Naira”) inside cords/Weavings.

## 6. Cords & Knots (Story Spine)
- Existing cords: **Blood & River** (water reciprocity between Naira and River Spirit) and **Mountain & Child** (stone protection between Apu Qocha and Naira).
- Extending the quipu:
  - **Option A** – New cord `Ancestors & Fields` (Khunu ↔ Apu Illimani) with `W06` knot (ritual vow to restore balance, echoes `kay:W01`, `hana:W02`).
  - **Option B** – Tie the burial scene into a water-focused cord via a lake/river entity.
- Long-term target: each cord spans at least two domains and gains ~3 knots (e.g., Blood & River = W01 encounter → W03 offering → W08 return). Cross-echoes ensure resonance (W08 echoes W06; W09 echoes W01).
- When you add a knot, specify `knot_type` (from `knot_types` list), `transformation`, and `echoes`.

## 7. Working With AI Partners
- Share current cord goals and Weaving templates when prompting AI.
- Ask for YAML-ready output or detailed notes you can translate.
- Humans review for Pacha voice, reciprocity, and symbolic consistency.
- Update `AGENTS.md` if collaboration agreements evolve so future AI calls inherit the same rules.

## 8. Connectedness Checklist
- **Every Weaving**: links to ≥1 cord, names entities_present, sets `threads_continued`, ends on relational transformation, includes a symbolic motif.
- **Quipu map**: no orphan Weavings; each knots onto a cord. Every cord touches ≥2 domains and recurs ≥3 times. Echoes point to specific `weaving_id`s.
- **Indices**: regenerated after any file change (don’t hand-edit `entities_index` / `weavings_index`).

## 9. Session Quick-Check
- [ ] Revisited `AGENTS.md` + `KHIPU_MAP.yaml`.
- [ ] Chose cord(s) needing attention.
- [ ] Drafted/updated Weaving YAML.
- [ ] Added/updated Entities as required.
- [ ] Inserted knots + echoes in `KHIPU_MAP.yaml`.
- [ ] Ran `python update_khipu.py`.
- [ ] Logged reflections on hana/kay/ukhu balance.

Maintain the quipu and every thread — human or AI — will stay aligned.

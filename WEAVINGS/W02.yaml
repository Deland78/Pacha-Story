summary: >
  Dr. Carlos Mamani experiences pachakuti during the 1992 meteor shower—a temporal folding where he witnesses Lake Titicaca as it existed a thousand years prior, at the base of Akapana Pyramid. The cosmic display connects him to Khunu's ancient vigil under the comet in W01, revealing that the act of witnessing sacred moments creates threads across time. The Staff God textile excavated that day serves as the physical anchor between past and present, while his daughters learn that ancestors speak through the earth and stars when the three Pachas align.
notes: >
  This scene establishes the modern timeline and introduces the Mamani family as contemporary witnesses. The pachakuti moment—where Carlos sees the lake where it was in ancient times—demonstrates that Pacha's folding nature allows certain individuals to perceive multiple temporal layers simultaneously. The meteor shower functions as a celestial echo of the comet in W01, suggesting cyclical moments when cosmic events tear the veil between times. Carlos's daughters represent the continuation of witnessing across generations, though they experience the moment differently—one with wonder (Maya), one with drowsiness (Cusi)—foreshadowing different relationships to ancestral knowledge. **Connect-to:** W01 (Tiwanaku Burial Discovery, 992 CE)

**Connection notes:** This scene mirrors the cosmic witnessing in W01, where Khunu observed the Elder's burial under starlight and comet-warning. Here, Carlos experiences a pachakuti—a temporal folding—that allows him to perceive Lake Titicaca as it was in the ancient past, possibly at the same moment as Khunu's vigil. The Staff God textile discovered in his excavation serves as a physical anchor connecting both moments. Both scenes feature the convergence of the three Pachas (Hanan/sky, Kay/earth, Ukhu/underworld) and both involve witnessing and remembering as sacred acts. The meteor shower functions as a celestial echo of the comet in W01, suggesting that these moments of cosmic display mark times when Pacha reveals its folded nature to those prepared to see.

summary: >
  Khunu witnesses the Elder's descent into the burial mound as the three Pachas converge. The comet's warning—spoken three years prior—is now inscribed in the failing fields and withered waters. The Staff God's textile becomes a vessel of continued reciprocity even as balance shifts: loss, not equals, must now be the measure of exchange.
notes: >
  The scene establishes the tri-domain resonance and introduces the central crisis of Pacha's folding. The Elder's death is not ending but threshold. The torches flicker against ancestral stars; the death song is the community's first utterance in the new calculus.

cords:
- name: Khunu's Threshold
  type: ritual
  connects:
  - Khunu
  - The Comet
  - The Community
  - The Elder
  - The Burial Mound
  - Dr. Carlos Mamani
  - Meteor Shower
  color: multi-colored (gold-earth-obsidian)
  notes: The witness becomes the threshold where all three Pachas meet and speak as
    one. This cord connects witnesses across time—Khunu and Carlos—both experiencing
    pachakuti when cosmic events align.
  knots:
  - weaving_id: W01
    knot_type: encounter
    transformation: 'Clarity of sight: the folding of Pacha becomes visible to one
      who watches with pure heart — Truth made manifest.'
  - weaving_id: W02
    knot_type: vision
    transformation: 'Witnessing transcends linear time: Carlos perceives Khunu''s
      moment across a millennium, proving that those who watch with reverence become
      threads in Pacha''s eternal weaving — The witness recognizes the witness.'
- name: Descent into Becoming
  type: ritual
  connects:
  - The Elder
  - The Burial Mound
  - Khunu
  color: obsidian
  notes: The passage from living presence to ancestral memory, witnessed and sealed.
  knots:
  - weaving_id: W01
    knot_type: transformation
    transformation: The Elder becomes ancestor; the mound becomes threshold — The
      passage is sealed and sacred.
- name: The Measure of Balance
  type: reciprocity
  connects:
  - The Community
  - The Suka Kollus
  - Dr. Carlos Mamani
  - Staff God Textile
  - Maya Mamani
  - Cusi Mamani
  color: earth
  notes: The covenant between humans and Pachamama, measured through teaching and
    transmission. What was failing in 992 CE becomes remembered wisdom in 1992—teaching
    passed through textile patterns across generations.
  knots:
  - weaving_id: W01
    knot_type: conflict
    transformation: The fields no longer mirror cosmic order—the breach between human
      and earth is made visible — Order shattered.
  - weaving_id: W02
    knot_type: memory
    transformation: 'Carlos teaches his daughters that ancestors speak through woven
      patterns and earth layers: the covenant is remembered even when broken, passed
      from great-great-grandmothers to modern children through reverence and attention
      — Teaching becomes the new reciprocity.'
- name: Stone and Water
  type: stone and water
  connects:
  - Pukara
  - Lake Titicaca
  color: gray-blue
  notes: The two cosmic presences respond differently to the folding of Pacha.
  knots:
  - weaving_id: W01
    knot_type: union
    transformation: Stone endures while water refuses—the two cosmic powers express
      the crisis differently — Divergence in response.
- name: Celestial Interpreter
  type: dream
  connects:
  - The Comet
  - Kalasasaya Temple
  - Meteor Shower
  - Akapana Pyramid
  color: gold
  notes: The message from the stars and the stone gateways that read it. Cosmic displays
    mark moments when Pacha reveals its folded nature—comet and meteor shower as celestial
    echoes across time.
  knots:
  - weaving_id: W01
    knot_type: memory
    transformation: The temple guards the axis where sky and earth meet; the comet's
      path shows that axis tilting—imbalance written in light — The center no longer
      holds.
  - weaving_id: W02
    knot_type: memory
    transformation: 'The meteor shower sings where the comet warned: ten simultaneous
      streaks echo the ancient omen, revealing that Hanan Pacha speaks in cycles—the
      same message repeated across generations for those who remember how to listen
      — Celestial memory encoded in light.'

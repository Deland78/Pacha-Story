- name: Khunu's Threshold
  type: ritual
  connects:
  - Khunu

  - The Community
  - The Elder
  - The Burial Mound
  - Dr. Carlos Mamani
  - Meteor Shower
  - The Chasqui
  - The 1532 Comet

  color: multi-colored (gold-earth-obsidian)
  notes: The witness becomes the threshold where all three Pachas meet and speak as
    one. This cord connects witnesses across time—Khunu (992), the Chasqui (1532),
    and Carlos (1992)—all experiencing pachakuti when cosmic events align. Each becomes
    the threshold through which Pacha knows itself.
  knots:
  - weaving_id: W01
    knot_type: encounter
    transformation: 'Clarity of sight: the folding of Pacha becomes visible to one
      who watches with pure heart — Truth made manifest.'
  - weaving_id: W02
    knot_type: vision
    transformation: 'Witnessing transcends linear time: Carlos perceives Khunu''s
      moment across a millennium, proving that those who watch with reverence become
      threads in Pacha''s eternal weaving — The witness recognizes the witness.'
  - weaving_id: W03
    knot_type: encounter
    transformation: 'The Chasqui as witness to epistemological crisis: the trusted
      messenger network carries impossible news, reality itself fracturing — Information
      remains reliable even as the world becomes unreliable.'
  - weaving_id: W04
    knot_type: vision
    transformation: Through fever clarity, the Chasqui sees the full pattern of collapse—disease,
      civil war, cosmic omen as one pachakuti — Empire revealed as mortal while Pacha
      endures.
  - weaving_id: W05
    knot_type: transformation
    transformation: 'The Chasqui becomes threshold at death: personal passage synchronized
      with imperial collapse and comet''s appearance — The witness becomes what Khunu
      was, what Carlos will recognize: the point where three Pachas converge.'
- name: Descent into Becoming
  type: ritual
  connects:
  - The Elder
  - The Burial Mound
  - Khunu
  - The Chasqui
  - Chucuito
  color: obsidian
  notes: The passage from living presence to ancestral memory, witnessed and sealed.
    From Kay Pacha to Ukhu Pacha—the transformation that makes ancestors of the living.
    Both the Elder (992) and the Chasqui (1532) undergo this witnessed passage.
  knots:
  - weaving_id: W01
    knot_type: transformation
    transformation: The Elder becomes ancestor; the mound becomes threshold — The
      passage is sealed and sacred.
  - weaving_id: W05
    knot_type: transformation
    transformation: 'The Chasqui passes from Kay to Ukhu Pacha as the comet blazes
      overhead: his death synchronized with empire''s collapse, his breath stopping
      as Tawantinsuyu''s coherence ends — Threshold sealed, pattern continuing.'
- name: The Measure of Balance
  type: reciprocity
  connects:
  - The Community
  - The Suka Kollus
  - Dr. Carlos Mamani
  - Staff God Textile
  - Maya Mamani
  - Cusi Mamani
  color: earth
  notes: The covenant between humans and Pachamama, measured through teaching and
    transmission. What was failing in 992 CE becomes remembered wisdom in 1992—teaching
    passed through textile patterns across generations.
  knots:
  - weaving_id: W01
    knot_type: conflict
    transformation: The fields no longer mirror cosmic order—the breach between human
      and earth is made visible — Order shattered.
  - weaving_id: W02
    knot_type: memory
    transformation: 'Carlos teaches his daughters that ancestors speak through woven
      patterns and earth layers: the covenant is remembered even when broken, passed
      from great-great-grandmothers to modern children through reverence and attention
      — Teaching becomes the new reciprocity.'
- name: Stone and Water
  type: stone and water
  connects:
  - Pukara
  - Lake Titicaca
  color: gray-blue
  notes: The two cosmic presences respond differently to the folding of Pacha.
  knots:
  - weaving_id: W01
    knot_type: union
    transformation: Stone endures while water refuses—the two cosmic powers express
      the crisis differently — Divergence in response.
- name: Celestial Interpreter
  type: dream
  connects:
  - The Comet
  - Kalasasaya Temple
  - Meteor Shower
  - Akapana Pyramid
  - The 1532 Comet
  - The Chasqui
  color: gold
  notes: The message from the stars and the stone gateways that read it. Cosmic displays
    mark moments when Pacha reveals its folded nature—992 comet, 1531/1532 comets,
    1992 meteor shower as celestial echoes across time. THE 1532 comet is the only
    one seen in present tense across all timelines.
  knots:
  - weaving_id: W01
    knot_type: memory
    transformation: The temple guards the axis where sky and earth meet; the comet's
      path shows that axis tilting—imbalance written in light — The center no longer
      holds.
  - weaving_id: W02
    knot_type: memory
    transformation: 'The meteor shower sings where the comet warned: ten simultaneous
      streaks echo the ancient omen, revealing that Hanan Pacha speaks in cycles—the
      same message repeated across generations for those who remember how to listen
      — Celestial memory encoded in light.'
  - weaving_id: W04
    knot_type: memory
    transformation: 'In fever-vision, the Chasqui remembers the 1531 comet blazing
      overhead as elders debated its meaning: "Pachakuti," they whispered, world-turning
      — The cosmic warning recognized but not yet fully understood.'
  - weaving_id: W05
    knot_type: transformation
    transformation: 'The 1532 comet appears through Pacha''s temporal folding—historically
      months past, yet present at the moment of death for those with purified sight:
      THE singular present-tense cosmic witness across all timelines, marking the
      synchronization of personal, imperial, and universal transformation — Hanan
      Pacha speaks directly into the threshold moment.'
- name: Thread of Messages
  type: reciprocity
  connects:
  - The Chasqui
  - Chasqui Lineage
  - The Chasqui Network
  - Tawantinsuyu
  - Chucuito
  color: multi-stranded
  notes: How empires bind themselves through communication; what happens when the
    network carries dissolution instead of cohesion. Three generations of chasquis
    (grandfather-son-grandson) embody the continuity of message-carrying even as empire
    dissolves. The messenger tradition persists beyond the political structure it
    was built to serve.
  knots:
  - weaving_id: W03
    knot_type: encounter
    transformation: 'Grandson''s arrival triggers memory of son bringing impossible
      rumors: the chasqui network remains reliable, but reality itself fractures —
      Messages don''t fail; the world becomes strange.'
  - weaving_id: W04
    knot_type: conflict
    transformation: 'The network built to unify now carries empire''s self-destruction:
      disease reports, civil war accounts, all arriving through trusted messenger
      chains — Communication continues even as what it communicates is collapse.'
  - weaving_id: W05
    knot_type: transformation
    transformation: 'Final message sent through death itself: the dying Chasqui tells
      his grandson to keep carrying messages even when there''s no empire to serve
      — The pattern continues in transformed form; three generations witness the shift.'
- name: Stone Endures, Empire Falls
  type: stone
  connects:
  - Tiwanaku Ruins
  - Pukara
  - Lake Titicaca
  - Chucuito
  - Akapana Pyramid
  - The Mountains
  color: gray
  notes: Sacred geography outlasting political structures. Tiwanaku fell 540 years
    before the Chasqui's 1492 journey; Tawantinsuyu falls in his 1532 death; Spanish
    will come; but the stones, mountains, and lake remember all and outlast all. The
    Chasqui recognizes this pattern—empire is mortal, pacha is not.
  knots:
  - weaving_id: W04
    knot_type: memory
    transformation: 'At age 40, stopping at Tiwanaku ruins during his Cusco run, the
      young Chasqui feels a chill: these monuments stood certain once, now five hundred
      forty years fallen — Foreshadowing his own empire''s mortality, pattern not
      yet consciously grasped.'
  - weaving_id: W05
    knot_type: return
    transformation: 'Dying in Chucuito, the same landscape that watched Tiwanaku fall:
      mountains patient, lake enduring, stones remembering — The Chasqui understands
      that he becomes what Tiwanaku became, but Pacha continues; geography outlasts
      politics.'

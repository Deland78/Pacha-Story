# Tiwanaku Burial Scene (992 CE)

Torches pushed back the darkness, as Khunu watched the Elder's bundled form being lowered into the burial mound.

Three years had passed since the comet tore across Hanan Pacha, its tail a written warning. They had all seen it –- shepherds on high pastures, farmers in their fields, priests at Kalasasaya's gates. The ancestors were speaking.

Now the canals ran shallow. The *suka kollus* that had fed generations yielded less each season, their intricate channels choked with silt and silence. Lake Titicaca had drawn back from its shores like a mouth refusing breath. The raised fields, once mirrors of cosmic order bridging Kay Pacha and Ukhu Pacha, were failing.

Above, stars pierced the thin air with ancient clarity. Pukara's shadow rose against them, that sacred *apu* standing witness as it had for countless generations. But even the mountain seemed diminished somehow, or perhaps it was they who had shrunk—their offerings smaller, their voices less certain when calling to the realms above and below.

The Elder wore a textile draped across his chest, adorned with the visage of the *Staff God*. Hands gripping serpents and staffs, rays streaming from his face toward all three realms. His son walked behind, wearing the warp-faced stripe patterns of Pachakuti.  Khunu understood the unspoken language: reciprocity must continue even in death, *ayni* binding the living to ancestors, the present to what came before and what would come after. Pacha demanded balance.

Yet balance had shifted. The comet had announced it, scratching light across the upper world's face. Now the inner world withheld its moisture, and Kay Pacha—their world of breath and labor—trembled between.

The Elder would join those who watched from beyond. Perhaps from that vantage, the pattern would reveal itself. Perhaps the ancestors understood what the living could only feel: that Pacha was folding.

The torches guttered. Someone began the death song, their voice small against the stars.

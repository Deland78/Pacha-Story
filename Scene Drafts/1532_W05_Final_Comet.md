# W05: The Final Comet, The Final Breath (1532 AD)
**Target: 746 words**

They carry him to the threshold.

His son on one side, grandson returned on the other, supporting weight that has become almost nothing. Through the doorway. Into the cold November night of Chucuito. Sky opens above him—vast, pricked with stars that have watched everything.

"So I can see," he whispers. So the sky can witness. So Pacha can know itself through his eyes one final time.

The ayllu gathers in the courtyard. Women bring textiles—his best alpaca weaving, the one with patterns his grandmother taught him meant *ayni*, reciprocity. Others chew corn for chicha, the sacred fermentation. Death requires ceremony. Passage requires witnesses.

His grandson kneels close, voice urgent: "The message from Cajamarca, *achachila*. You need to know."

The old man's hand finds the young runner's wrist. Pulses there—swift, strong. Life insisting on itself.

"Tell me."

"At Cajamarca, they—" The grandson's voice fractures. "Atahualpa went to meet the strangers. For parley, they said. But it was slaughter. Thousands dead in moments. The thunder-weapons—" 

His son's hand tightens on his shoulder. "The Sapa Inca is captured. Held for ransom."

The empire's center has collapsed. The Qorikancha sun-disc might still blaze in Cusco, but its light no longer reaches here. 

Tawantinsuyu has stopped being whole.

The old man closes his eyes. Opens them. And sees—

**The comet.**

**Impossible. It had appeared in March, April maybe—months ago, when he could still walk unassisted. Atahualpa's Comet, people named it, not realizing how prophetic that would prove.**

**But there: blazing across the southern sky, tail streaming like torn cloud made of light itself.**

The women gasp. His son's breath catches. The grandson's eyes go wide.

They see it too.

Not memory—presence. The sky folding time back on itself, or perhaps he is folding, slipping between Kay Pacha's present and what lies beyond. Pachakuti makes time fluid. The comet appears for those with eyes purified by approaching death.

"*A comet*," someone whispers.

"Like the one in '31," another voice. "But brighter."

He understands what they cannot: this is the same one. And also the comet from 992 when Tiwanaku was failing, ancestors watching their raised fields refuse water. The same one that will return in 1992 as meteor shower over Akapana's excavated stones, when a man named Carlos will see through time's layers to this exact moment.

All the same comet. Or all comets the same message: *witness*.

The light bathes his face. Gold-white, cold as altitude, bright as all certainties ending.

His mind reaches back—can't help it—to running Isla Del Sol to Cusco. Age forty, body strong, empire stronger. That perfect certainty. The sacred lake reflecting sun-bright off its surface, Tiwanaku's ruins testament to... what? He'd thought: to impermanence requiring vigilance. Now he knows: to pattern. All empires follow the same path into stone and silence.

But the people? The *ayllu* rhythms, the *ayni* exchanges, the knowing how to live with altitude and quinoa and llamas and Lake Titicaca's temperament—those persist. Survived Tiwanaku's fall. Will survive Tawantinsuyu's.

The conquistadores will come. The bearded strangers with their thunder-weapons and floating houses. They'll rename the sacred sites, mispronounce the mountains, fail to understand reciprocity.

But they won't erase Pacha. Can't.

He looks at his grandson. At his son. Three generations of chasquis.

"Keep—" His voice barely breath. "Keep carrying messages."

"*Achachila*—"

"Even when there's no empire to serve. Carry them." The words cost everything. "The pattern... continues... different forms..."

The comet blazes overhead. Its light reflects in his dimming eyes, filling them with celestial fire.

He thinks: I am becoming what Khunu witnessed in 992. The threshold where three Pachas meet. The passage that must be seen and sealed.

"Remember Tiwanaku," he breathes. To his grandson, to his son, to the ayllu, to the mountains. "Reciprocity outlasts... politics..."

His chest hitches. The breath that should follow doesn't come.

Hangs there—the moment between inhale and what comes after.

The comet reaches zenith. Light cascades down, touches his still-open eyes.

Somewhere, women begin the death song. The sound small against infinity, but continuing. Like messages will continue. Like Pacha continues, folding time so the living and the dead and those not yet born all occupy the same eternal threshold.

His son's hand on his chest, feeling for breath that has stopped.

His grandson's tears falling hot against cold cheeks.

The ayllu witnessing.

The mountains remembering.

The comet burning patient overhead, marking this *pachakuti*—this world-turning where empire ends but the land endures, where one runner passes to Ukhu Pacha and younger legs keep the pattern alive.

From Kay to Ukhu. From living to ancestor.

Threshold sealed.

The message continues.

# Tiwanaku Burial Scene (992 CE)

The torches carved shadows from the darkness, and Khunu watched the priests arrange offerings around the elder's bundled form. Three years had passed since the comet tore across Hanan Pacha, its tail writing warnings no one could misread. They had all seen it—shepherds on high pastures, farmers in their fields, priests at Kalasasaya's gates. The ancestors were speaking.

Now the canals ran shallow. The *suka kollus* that had fed generations yielded less each season, their intricate channels choked with silt and silence. Lake Titicaca had drawn back from its shores like a mouth refusing breath. The raised fields, once mirrors of cosmic order bridging Kay Pacha and Ukhu Pacha, were failing.

Above, stars pierced the thin air with ancient clarity. Illimani's shadow rose against them, that sacred *apu* standing witness as it had for countless generations. But even the mountain seemed diminished somehow, or perhaps it was they who had shrunk—their offerings smaller, their voices less certain when calling to the realms above and below.

The priests placed chicha vessels and woven cloth beside the elder, creating pathways for his journey through the layered worlds. On the textile draped across his chest, the Staff God stood eternal—hands gripping serpents and staffs, rays streaming from his face toward all three realms. Khunu understood the language: reciprocity must continue even in death, *ayni* binding the living to ancestors, the present to what came before and what would come after. Pacha demanded balance.

Yet balance had shifted. The comet had announced it, scratching light across the upper world's face. Now the inner world withheld its moisture, and Kay Pacha—their world of breath and labor—trembled between. 

The elder would join those who watched from beyond, adding his voice to theirs. Perhaps from that vantage, the pattern would reveal itself. Perhaps the ancestors understood what the living could only feel: that Pacha was folding, that time turned in ways the canals no longer could.

The torches guttered. Someone began the death song, their voice small against the stars.

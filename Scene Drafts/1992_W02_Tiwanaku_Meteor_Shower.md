# Tiwanaku Meteor Shower Scene (1992)

The setting sun cast long shadows across the Akapana Pyramid excavations. Dr. Carlos Mamani crouched beside the latest trench, brushing soil from an elaborate textile fragment. His wife, Jennifer, sat on a folding chair nearby, sketching the site.

"Munaycha! Cusicha!" Carlos called, his voice calm but his face serious.

The girls stood up from where they'd been poking at pottery shards. "Yes, Papa," they responded in unison.

"Come here, please. I want to show you something important."

Ten-year-old Cusi dragged her feet as she approached, while thirteen-year-old Maya followed with slightly more interest. Carlos pointed to the textile, its warp-faced stripe patterns still visible despite a millennium in the earth.

"Listen, our ancestors are speaking to us now in this clothing they made while teaching their children about Pacha—about the cosmos, the land, and the waters."

Cusi yawned.

The evening light faded as they walked down the ancient paths south in the direction of Lake Titicaca. Carlos checked his watch and nodded satisfactorily—stalling the last hour had made the timing perfect.

Stars were appearing overhead, piercing the thin air of the altiplano with ancient clarity.

"You girls are tired. Let's rest here." Carlos spread a blanket on flat ground beside the trail.

They lay back together, the girls between their parents.

"Any minute," she said, looking at her own watch.

"Any minute what?" Maya asked.

Carlos's voice took on the tone he used for the old stories. "Feel the earth beneath us—the Ukhu Pacha, home of our ancestors. Now look up at the stars, the Hanan Pacha. Tonight, they will sing of the future."

The girls looked at their parents, who were both smiling. Something in their parents' anticipation made them turn back to the sky.

The first meteor drew a bright line across the dark sky.

"Oh!" Cusi breathed.

More meteors followed, building from a trickle to a torrent. Ten, twenty meteors per minute. Then, in a five-second moment that seemed to make time stop—or more like all times were present at once above that ancient city—ten brilliant streaks emerged from the focal point and spread out across the sky more slowly than those before.

Out of the corner of his eye, Carlos saw the fiery streaks reflected in water. But there was no water there.

He turned. The meteors reflected in the smooth surface of Lake Titicaca.

Water stretched before him, vast and silver-dark, segmented by the reflected fiery lines. He could hear water against stone. He could smell the mineral-rich scent of the sacred lake.

Torches flickered in the distance, approaching. A ceremonial procession passed by them on the path from the shoreline to the pyramid. There body on the litter covered with a textile with the markings of the Staff God. From the lakeshore came angry shouts in Spanish, boots stomping, steel swords being unsheathed and screams.  

As the ten meteor streaks faded, the lake and its ghosts also receded into the ground, and there was only dry earth and distance again.

"Ooooh!" Cusi was saying. "Did you see all those - how many were there?"

"I counted ten!" Maya's usual teenage restraint had dissolved into pure amazement.

"Pachakuti," Carlos whispered.

"What does that mean?" Jennifer whispered back, her head still on his shoulder.

"A Quechua term for an inflection, turning, or overturning of space-time." His voice was unsteady. "I saw the lake. Jenny, I saw it—here. The water was there, and the torches; funeral procession passed by us on this trail, and..." He stopped himself there.

She squeezed his hand. "I know."

"You saw it too?"

"No. But I felt you leave for a moment. Where did you go?"

"I was here," he said, wrapping his arm around her. "There's another textile to find with the staff of God on it."

 

Above them, the stars still whispered. Below them, the earth held seeds of a thousand harvests, a thousand burials, a thousand moments when the three Pacha touched and time folded over itself like the weft crossing the warp.

# W03: Strange Winds from Distant Waters (1532 AD)
**Target: 550 words**

The grandson's footsteps arrive before his shadow.

Nayra hears them through the clay walls of his dwelling in Chucuito—barefoot rhythm on packed earth, the pattern he knows. A chasqui's approach, breath controlled even at altitude. His own breath comes ragged, shallow. Fever burns behind his eyes.

The doorway darkens. Cold altiplano air rushes in, carrying November's edge.

"*Achachila*." The young voice cracks slightly. Twenty summers, maybe fewer. Sweat on his brow despite the cold.

The grandson kneels. Words tumble out, breathless not from running but from their weight: soldiers gathering near Cajamarca, messengers arriving with impossible accounts, the Sapa Inca himself—

The old man's vision blurs. Fever? Or memory?

**His son filling this same doorway. Younger then, the old man still strong enough to stand without aid. Sunlight, not shadow. His son's chasqui legs dust-stained from the routes north through Collasuyu.**

**"*Tayta*, the messages from Tumbes—" His son's voice uncertain, seeking permission to disbelieve. "The runners speak of bearded men in floating houses. Animals larger than llamas that men ride upon. Weapons that make thunder without storms."**

**He had laughed. Not mockery—unease dressed as disbelief. The chasqui network was reliable. It had to be. Messages bound Tawantinsuyu together more surely than rope bridges, more permanently than stone roads. A messenger who brought false words was worse than none at all.**

**"The network is sound," he'd told his son, old hands resting on younger shoulders. "But men exaggerate what they fear. Strange traders, perhaps. Coastal peoples have always told wild stories."**

**His son had nodded, wanting to believe him. Wanting the world to stay known.**

The present crashes back. His grandson's voice: "—they say Atahualpa has been—"

"Stop." The word costs him breath. His hand trembles as he lifts it.

Outside, the mountains stand patient against the sky. They have watched Tiwanaku rise and crumble into monoliths. They remember empires the chasquis never carried messages for.

His son enters now, middle-aged, no longer running routes. He brings coca leaves, begins preparing the wad for the old man's cheek. The bitter green carries small comfort.

"Tell him," his son says to the grandson. 

The old man understands what they cannot: the messages were true. All of them. The bearded strangers, the impossible animals, the thunder-weapons—all true. The chasqui network hadn't failed. Reality had.

He remembers running these same routes at the grandson's age. The sureness of it. Each tambo placed exactly right, each runner knowing their section absolutely. Information flowing like water through canals, binding the *Tawantinsuyu*—the four parts made whole through knowing, through shared truth.

But if truth itself fractures? If the world becomes strange enough that reliable messengers must carry unreliable news?

The fever spikes. He sees the fraying—not in the network, but in the fabric it tried to bind. The quipu cords of empire twisting, knotting wrong, meaning slipping away like water from broken channels.

His grandson's hand finds his, warm and certain. Young fingers that have gripped message-cords, that will keep gripping them even when empire dissolves.

"What should I tell them?" the young chasqui asks. "*Achachila*, when I run back, what words should I carry?"

The old man tastes coca's bitterness, feels his chest labor for air. Through the doorway, Lake Titicaca holds the sunset's last copper. The same lake that refused Tiwanaku. The same that will remember Tawantinsuyu when its name is only echo.

He cannot answer. Because the message that needs carrying is this: the world is becoming unfamiliar, and no runner is fast enough to outpace that strangeness.

His breath rattles. The grandson's grip tightens.

Outside, wind crosses the altiplano, bearing scents they cannot name.

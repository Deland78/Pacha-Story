# Tiwanaku Burial Scene (992 CE)

Torches pushed back the darkness, as Khunu watched the Elder's bundled form being lowered into the burial mound.

Three years had passed since the comet tore across Hanan Pacha, its tail a written warning. They had all seen it –- shepherds on high pastures, farmers in their fields, priests at Kalasasaya's gates. The ancestors were speaking.

**The flames before him twisted. His breath caught.**

**The comet's tail had split the sky, and then—the world folded. Stone road carved into mountainside. Each footfall jarring through his bones. The Milky Way sprawled across peaks sharper than any he knew. His chest burned, lungs pulling at thin air that tasted of smoke.**

**Below: a city spreading wider than Tiwanaku had ever been. Terraces climbed impossible heights. Temples with walls fitted so precisely no mortar showed. And everywhere—flame. Orange light consuming roofs, turning gold and stone into a brazier beneath the stars.**

**He ran toward it. Chest heaving, legs striking the carved road, heart hammering terror through him. Unable to stop.**

**Then the comet's tail faded and he stood in the field again. He told no one.**

Now the canals ran shallow. The *suka kollus* that had fed generations yielded less each season, their intricate channels choked with silt and silence. Lake Titicaca had drawn back from its shores like a mouth refusing breath. The raised fields, once mirrors of cosmic order bridging Kay Pacha and Ukhu Pacha, were failing.

Above, stars pierced the thin air with ancient clarity. Pukara's shadow rose against them, that sacred *apu* standing witness as it had for countless generations. But even the mountain seemed diminished somehow, or perhaps it was they who had shrunk—their offerings smaller, their voices less certain when calling to the realms above and below.

The Elder wore a textile draped across his chest, adorned with the visage of the *Staff God*. Hands gripping serpents and staffs, rays streaming from his face toward all three realms. His son walked behind, wearing the warp-faced stripe patterns of Pachakuti. Khunu understood the unspoken language: reciprocity must continue even in death, *ayni* binding the living to ancestors, the present to what came before and what would come after. Pacha demanded balance.

Yet balance had shifted. The comet had announced it, scratching light across the upper world's face. Now the inner world withheld its moisture, and Kay Pacha—their world of breath and labor—trembled between.

The Elder would join those who watched from beyond. Perhaps from that vantage, the pattern would reveal itself. Perhaps the ancestors understood what the living could only feel: that Pacha was folding.

**The torches guttered, and for a heartbeat the burning city flashed behind his eyes again—always there, always waiting.**

Someone began the death song, their voice small against the stars.

# W04: The Sapa Inca Falls, The Comet Warned (1532 AD)
**Target: 650 words**

---

Night folds the altiplano in cold darkness.

His son chews coca leaves slow and deliberate, the ritual forming green pulp against his cheek before offering the wad to the old man's lips. Bitter. Always bitter. But the old ways open thresholds.

Women move at the dwelling's edges, preparing. Textiles. Chicha. The daughter-in-law's murmur like water over stones. His grandson has left to carry messages back—the pattern continuing even as the one who began it fails.

Smoke curls from a small clay brazier. Tobacco mixed with dried herbs. The scent pulls at memory's edges.

His son's voice: "Huáscar is dead. The northern armies—" 

But the words scatter like ash.

**Disease came first. Or had it? Time slides, fever-slick.**

**The chasqui network carried the message that broke the world: Sapa Inca Huayna Capac, son of the Sun himself, had died screaming. Not in battle—honorable, comprehensible. But covered in pustules, skin erupting like a plague-land, fever eating him from inside.**

**If the divine could die of disease, what remained certain?**

**The sickness spread faster than runners. Entire villages emptied. The old man had stood in his ayllu's center in Chucuito, making decisions. Which families to separate. What offerings to make. His son, then still running routes, had brought report after report: the northern valleys devastated, the coastal peoples dying in greater numbers than could be buried.**

**And then—civil war. As if disease weren't enough wound.**

**Huáscar. Atahualpa. Two sons, both legitimate by different mothers. Collasuyu supported Huáscar—he was southern, traditional, the rightful heir. But Atahualpa commanded armies hardened by northern campaigns. Brother against brother. The empire's dual moieties, which should have been complementary, tearing at each other like Pukara mountain splitting in earthquake.**

**Messages arrived fragmentary: battles won and lost, generals executed, women and children slaughtered to end bloodlines. The chasqui network, built to unify, now carried empire's self-destruction.**

**Then the comet.**

**Halley's burning arc across the sky, the previous year. He had been strong enough to stand outside then, neck craned back, watching it blaze. The elders gathered in Chucuito's center, debating meaning.**

**"Pachakuti," some said. World-turning. The great reversal.**

**Others argued for hope—ancestors sending warnings so the living might change course.**

**But he knew. Standing there beneath that cosmic flame, he understood with the same certainty he'd felt running messages in his youth: this marked the end of something. Not a battle's end. Not a drought's end. The end of a world's coherence.**

The coca's bitterness floods his mouth. His son's hand on his shoulder, grounding him.

Present moment: the dwelling's clay walls, firelight catching woven alpaca patterns, his own breath shallow and wrong.

**But memory won't release him.**

**Forty years earlier—is that all? It feels like different lives, different worlds—running from Isla Del Sol to Cusco. Age forty, his body a perfect instrument of speed and altitude. The empire at its height, Huayna Capac still living, still organizing *mita* labor that built roads and terraces, still binding the *Tawantinsuyu* in reciprocity.**

**He'd stopped at Tiwanaku's ruins midway. Had to. Every chasqui did.**

**The monoliths stood patient and inhuman, carved by ancestors so ancient the Inca didn't claim them. The Gateway of the Sun faced east, alignments perfect for observations no one living understood. The Akapana pyramid rose in seven tiers—seven levels of Pacha folded into stone.**

**Already five hundred forty years in ruins. A civilization that had commanded Lake Titicaca's waters, that had built cities when Cusco was nothing—returned to stones and silence.**

**Standing there, young and strong and certain of empire's permanence, he'd felt a chill that had nothing to do with altitude.**

**Now, dying, he understands what that chill meant: all empires become Tiwanaku. Even this one. Even Tawantinsuyu with its perfect roads and divine emperors and messenger network faster than thought.**

**Stone endures. Mountains endure. The lake endures.**

**But empires?**

His son's voice pulls him back: "Rest, *awki*. The night is long."

He tastes coca, smoke, the copper of his own failing. But through it all—clarity. The fevered kind, bright and final.

Empires are mortal. Pacha is not.

His breath catches, releases.

The ritual continues.

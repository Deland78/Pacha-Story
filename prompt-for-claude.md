Claude,

Please set up our Pacha Story HQ teamspace in Notion using the resources in Google Drive and the instructions we prepared. You have access to:
- Google Drive folder: `Pacha Story HQ`
- Notion workspace: `Pacha Story HQ`

### Tasks

1. **Follow the setup guide** `notion-setup-guide.md` located at `Google Drive > Pacha Story HQ > notion-setup-guide.md`. Create all databases with the exact property names, types, and default views described.
2. **Build the dashboard** using `notion-dashboard-layout.md` (same folder). Embed the specified linked views, progress widgets, and daily digest section.
3. **Configure integrations**:
   - Enable both ChatGPT and Claude connectors with read/write access to all new databases.
   - Sync Google Drive files (especially Research Library PDFs) as described in the guide.
4. **Implement the approval workflow** by ensuring every database includes the `Needs Approval` status property and creating filtered views for pending approvals.
5. **Automate the daily digest** email to both me and Dad using the format outlined in section 5 of the guide. Also drop the same content into the dashboard’s Daily Digest block each evening.
6. **Migrate seed content** from Drive: import the existing markdown files (story summary, chasqui profile, celestial events) into the appropriate databases/pages; confirm assets like `eclipse_freq_8bit_print.jpg` are placed in the Assets gallery.
7. **Run post-setup checks** listed in section 7 of the setup guide, then send us a confirmation note within Notion.

Let me know in Notion if you hit any blockers or need clarifications. Thank you!

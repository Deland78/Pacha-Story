# Collaboration Model — Common Path Forward

## Motivation & Goals
- Growth through creative friction; calm, process-first collaboration.
- Prioritise causation/logic, continuity, and reader impact over preference.
- Sustain weekly momentum with lightweight artifacts and clear ownership.

## Preferred Collaboration Model(s)
**Model:** Two‑Track Outline + Pass‑and‑Edit Hybrid  
- Start from a human **broad beat sheet**; AI proposes chapter beats for approval.  
- Alternate scene/POV ownership; cross‑POV edits must reference beats.  
- Weekly exchanges; **48‑hour feedback** target (1‑week hard cap).  
- AI assists/audits; it may recommend, **never decides**.

## Strengths & Champion Areas
- Structural logic, worldbuilding, and descriptive texture.  
- Process‑oriented collaboration with defined decision rights.  
- Voice and factual/continuity discipline.

## AI Roles + Human Gates (HITL %)
| Stage | AI Role | AI % | Human Gate |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Idea Generation** | Beat/scene expander | 50–60% | Approve prompts & rationales |
| **Outlining** | Beat proposer on top of human broad beats | 50–75% | Lock chapter beats |
| **First Drafting** | Scene drafter (owner revises) | **60–80%** | Owner accepts/revises |
| **Line Editing / Style** | Voice‑match tester | 60–80% | **Pass if ≥82% → 85% once stable** |
| **Continuity / Factual** | Timeline/canon auditor | 70–90% | Human sign‑off on tests |
| **Final Approval / Polish** | — | 0% | Human consensus; single stylist for final pass |

## Chosen AI Architecture
**Hybrid: Two‑Track Outline + Reviewer Loop**  
- AI runs early drafts and continuity checks; partners review weekly.  
- **Proof Pack (cap: 1 page) each pass:** (1) Source & Continuity bundle, (2) Style conformance test (target ≥85%), (3) Draft diff + rationale, (4) Logic/Tension checks.

## Decision Rights
- **Creator fixes** their introduced causal issues before partner review.  
- **Scene/Chapter owner has final say**, with **one overrule per chapter** to prevent stalemates.

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Voice drift** → enforce style tests; human approves diffs.  
- **Continuity breaks** → evaluator timeline tests per scene.  
- **Over‑planning** → artifacts capped at 1 page; review per chapter.  
- **Time‑zone delays** → alternating ownership; escalate after 1 week.

## Cadence & Tracking
- Weekly hand‑offs with a 48‑hour feedback SLA (1‑week cap).  
- Track status/owner/risks/tests in Notion; consistent file naming.

## Definition of “Done”
- Chapter passes: AI → Owner → Stylist **(whole‑book polish before “done”)**.  
- Final approval is always **human consensus**.

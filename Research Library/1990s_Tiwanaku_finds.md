# 1990s Archaeological Findings at Tiwanaku

## Major 1990s Discoveries

### Proyecto Wila Jawira (Kolata & Rivera)
- Rediscovery and study of *suka kollus* (raised field agriculture)
- Evidence of drought and environmental stress
- Refined chronologies of Tiwanaku's occupation

### Akapana Pyramid Excavations
- Evidence of human sacrifice and violent burials from around 910 CE
- Signs of rebellion and burning around 1000 CE
- Discovery of kero-shattering rituals

### Underwater Archaeology (1988-1992)
- 385 artifacts recovered from Lake Titicaca
- Gold Staff God medallions and ceremonial offerings
- Evidence of ritual deposition in sacred waters

### Burial Practices
- Below-ground burials with elaborate textiles
- Warp-faced stripe patterns and polychrome weaving
- Modest social differentiation in grave goods

### Putuni Palace
- Evidence of burning during 1000 CE rebellion
- Signs of violent conflict and social upheaval

## Major Researchers (1990s)

- **Alan L. Kolata** (University of Chicago) - Led Proyecto Wila Jawira
- **Oswaldo Rivera** (Bolivian National Director) - Co-director of major excavations
- **John Wayne Janusek** - Ceramic chronology and synthesis work
- **Carlos Ponce Sanginés** - Influential predecessor whose work informed 1990s research

## Project Connections

### Alignment with W01 (992 CE Burial Scene)

**Exceptional Historical Accuracy:**
- The 992 CE burial scene timing is perfect - just before the 1000 CE collapse
- Burial practices match archaeological evidence (below-ground, with textiles)
- Environmental context aligns with drought evidence from raised field research
- Social dynamics reflect the tension period (910-1000 CE)

### ENTITIES Validation

All major entities are grounded in archaeological record:
- **Staff God** - Gold medallions found in underwater archaeology
- **Raised fields (suka kollus)** - Central to Proyecto Wila Jawira findings
- **Burial mound** - Matches below-ground burial practices
- **Comet** - Fits cosmological interpretation of collapse period
- **Elder** - Represents social structure documented in burial differentiation

### Thematic Resonance

The W01 weaving's transformation theme of "reciprocal loss" perfectly captures:
- Environmental collapse (drought affecting raised fields)
- Social collapse (rebellion and burning around 1000 CE)
- Ritual transformation (kero-shattering, human sacrifice)
- The interconnection between human and cosmic order

## Creative Opportunities

### Underwater Offerings Connection
- Potential narrative linking 992 CE ritual depositions to 1992 archaeological recovery
- Gold Staff God medallions as timeline bridges

### Violent Burials and Social Tension
- 910-1000 CE period of conflict
- Evidence of human sacrifice
- Rebellion and burning of elite structures

### Textile Details
- Warp-faced stripe patterns
- Polychrome weaving techniques
- Burial textiles as social markers

### 1992 Archaeologist Interaction
- Characters interacting with Kolata's active research
- Discovery moments paralleling ancient rituals
- Modern archaeological interpretation of ancient events

## Historical Significance

The 1990s research at Tiwanaku revolutionized understanding of:
- Agricultural technology and environmental adaptation
- Causes of societal collapse (drought, social upheaval)
- Ritual practices and cosmological beliefs
- Timeline refinement for key events (910 CE violence, 1000 CE collapse)

This research validates the creative vision while offering specific material details to deepen authenticity and demonstrates sophisticated understanding of Tiwanaku cosmology and the historical moment of collapse.

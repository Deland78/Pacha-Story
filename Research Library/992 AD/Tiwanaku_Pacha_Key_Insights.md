# Tiwanaku & Pacha: Key Insights (Condensed Summary)

## 1. Tiwanaku Overview
- **Civilization:** Pre-Inca Andean polity centered near Lake Titicaca, flourished c. 500–1000 CE.
- **Location:** High-altitude Altiplano, c. 3,800 meters above sea level.
- **Character:** Sacred city rather than urban capital—architecture aligned with sun, mountains, and water.

## 2. Cosmological Framework: Pacha
- **Pacha** = unified space-time-world concept; interwoven rather than linear.
- **Three Realms:**
  - **Hanan Pacha:** Upper world of sky, sun, and ancestors.
  - **Kay Pacha:** Living world of humans, reciprocity (*ayni*), and balance.
  - **Ukhu Pacha:** Inner world of ancestors, fertility, and transformation.
- These realms are porous; ritual, architecture, and daily labor bridge them continuously.

## 3. Tiwanaku Culture & Lifestyle
- **Architecture:** Temples (Kalasasaya, Akapana, Pumapunku) mirrored cosmic and hydrological systems.
- **Agriculture:** Ingenious raised fields (*suka kollus*) with canal systems moderated frost and maintained fertility.
- **Social Structure:** Cooperative labor rooted in *ayni* (reciprocal exchange of work and goods).
- **Art & Belief:** Hybrid human-animal iconography (condor, puma, serpent) signified transformation and continuity between realms.
- **Ritual Life:** Seasonal festivals, solstice alignments, offerings to ancestors, and cyclical renewal of social contracts.

## 4. Signs of Decline (~950–1100 CE)
- **Political Fragmentation:** Central authority weakened; monument building ceased.
- **Environmental Change:** Shift toward aridity; Lake Titicaca levels fell, canals and fields failed.
- **Agricultural Breakdown:** Decline in raised-field productivity undermined surplus economies.
- **Social Dispersal:** Provincial centers abandoned; people reorganized into smaller Aymara polities.
- **Cultural Continuity:** Tiwanaku remained a sacred landscape, reinterpreted by later Andean cultures including the Inca.

## 5. Thematic Focus for Scene Writing (992 CE onward)
- **Mood:** Foreboding equilibrium—cosmic misalignment mirrors social strain.
- **Symbolism:** Dimming sun or disrupted water flow as omens of imbalance.
- **Tone:** Reverent, cyclical, reflective—transition from flourishing reciprocity to quiet dissolution.
- **Core Idea:** The world does not end; it shifts—Pacha folds, time turns, ancestors await renewal.

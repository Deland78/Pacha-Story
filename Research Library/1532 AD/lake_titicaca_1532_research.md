# The People of Lake Titicaca in 1532: Life under Inca Rule and Tiwanaku Heritage

## Historical Context: Inca Rule in the Titicaca Region (Collasuyu)

By 1532, the Indigenous Aymara-speaking peoples around Lake Titicaca’s southeastern shores (in the Collao region) had been part of the Inca Empire for several generations. The Incas had gradually conquered the local Aymara lordships through protracted wars in the 15th century. After subjugation, most of these Aymara lords became allies of the Inca state and were allowed a form of indirect rule with considerable autonomy.

In practice, this meant that by the early 1500s, local chiefs (kurakas) near Lake Titicaca retained much of their authority, ruling their communities under overall Inca sovereignty. The Incas named this quarter of their empire Collasuyu after the Colla people, reflecting the region’s importance.

Inca emperors undertook pilgrimages to Lake Titicaca’s sacred sites — the Island of the Sun, the Island of the Moon, and the ruins of Tiwanaku — to perform rituals affirming their divine mandate. These journeys were essential to Inca cosmology, as their origin myths placed the birth of the sun and the Incas themselves at Lake Titicaca.

During the Inca civil war (1529–1532) between Huáscar and Atahualpa, the southeastern Lake Titicaca region was under Huáscar’s control. The local Aymara elites thus sided with Huáscar. After Atahualpa’s victory and Huáscar’s death, these elites found themselves on the losing side—an unstable situation as the Spaniards arrived later that year.

## Daily Life on the Altiplano in 1532

The Lake Titicaca basin is a high-altitude plateau with a harsh climate. The local Aymara communities were agricultural and pastoral. They cultivated hardy crops like potatoes, oca, and quinoa. Chuño (freeze-dried potatoes) was a staple. Maize and coca were imported from lower valleys via mitmaqkuna colonies organized by the Inca state.

Llamas and alpacas were central to their herding economy. Fish and waterbirds were harvested from the lake. The Uros people, distinct from the Aymara, lived on floating reed islands and maintained a traditional way of life.

Aymara society was organized around ayllus (kin-based groups), and each community was divided into dual moieties (upper and lower). Local leaders maintained religious and civic authority. Rituals, social organization, and cranial deformation (head-shaping) were part of the cultural norms.

## Tiwanaku Heritage and Aymara Traditions

The Tiwanaku civilization had collapsed centuries earlier, but its influence endured. Many Aymara-speaking people retained spiritual beliefs, burial practices, and architectural forms that echoed Tiwanaku.

Puquina, believed to be the language of Tiwanaku, persisted in the area alongside Aymara and Quechua. Religious traditions included ancestor worship centered on chullpas (funerary towers) and elaborate funerary rites. Sacrifices of servants or animals often accompanied elite burials.

Ritual offerings to mountains, lakes, and sacred stones (huacas) continued. The worship of Viracocha and the sun god (Inti), partly reinforced by Inca ideology, was layered over older traditions. Material culture, such as textile patterns and ceramic motifs, preserved Tiwanaku styles.

## Sacred Sites and Temples in 1532

By 1532, the city of Tiwanaku was in ruins but still revered. Massive stone monuments, such as the Akapana pyramid and monolithic statues, remained standing. Locals attributed these constructions to ancient supernatural beings or mythic ancestors, not the Incas.

Although the Tiwanaku temple complex was not in active use, it was spiritually significant. Incas constructed administrative buildings nearby, possibly to maintain symbolic control.

Other ritual sites, like the Island of the Sun, were thriving. This island hosted the Inca Temple of the Sun and was the site of major pilgrimages and offerings. Underwater archaeology near the Khoa reef has revealed Inca-era sacrifices of gold, silver, and llamas.

## The Inca Civil War and Local Allegiances

The southeastern Lake Titicaca region supported Huáscar in the civil war. After Atahualpa’s victory, local leaders found themselves in a precarious position. Some welcomed the Spanish invasion as an opportunity to escape domination by northern Inca generals.

The region did not see major battles but was politically aligned with Huáscar. The arrival of the Spaniards in late 1532 disrupted the fragile post-civil war order and introduced a new era of colonial imposition.

## Conclusion

The people of the southeastern Lake Titicaca region in 1532 lived at the intersection of Inca imperialism, Tiwanaku heritage, and their own deeply rooted Aymara traditions. While the Incas integrated the region into their cosmology and administration, local leaders and communities retained significant autonomy and cultural identity. Ritual practices, language diversity, and sacred landscapes all reflected the endurance of pre-Inca beliefs and the adaptability of highland Andean life.

Despite the political upheaval of the Inca civil war and the Spanish conquest, the social and spiritual foundations of these communities showed remarkable continuity and resilience.

Storyworld Overview\n\n**Working Title:** *[Insert Title — e.g., Threads of the Returning Light]*  \n**Story Essence:** A weaving of beings, times, and spaces across the three Pachas — **Hana (upper)**, **Kay (living)**, and **Ukhu (inner/ancestral)**.  \n**Genre/Mode:** Mythic-historical fiction grounded in Andean cosmology and ecological memory.  \n**Temporal Logic:** Non-linear, recursive, relational. Time is not a sequence but a field of echoes.  \n**Intent:** To embody *Pacha* — the unity of space, time, and being — through narrative pattern and reciprocity.\n\n## 2. Relational Voices\n\nInstead of a single point of view, the story is told through **multiple resonant voices** that move between worlds.\n\n| Voice | Domain | Tone / Register | Mode of Speech |\n|-------|---------|----------------|----------------|\n| Human (protagonist or wanderer) | Kay Pacha | intimate, sensory | dialogue, thought |\n| Ancestor / Memory | Ukhu Pacha | slow, echoing | dream, ritual fragment |\n| Elemental Being (mountain, river, wind) | Hana or Kay | cyclic, impersonal | sound, silence, symbol |\n| Collective Voice (community, ritual chorus) | All | rhythmic, shared | chant, pattern |\n\n> Voices are not “characters” but *threads of perception* that braid and unbraid through the story.\n\n## 3. Weavings (Story Units)\n\nReplace scenes or chapters with **Weavings** — intersections of beings, moments, and meanings.\n\nEach Weaving entry (in your writing files) should contain:\n\n```yaml\nweaving_id: W07\ndomain: kay\nthreads_continued: [hana:W02, ukhu:W04]\nevent_form: encounter, ritual, memory\ntransformation: “realization of shared ancestry”\nsymbolic_motif: hummingbird / obsidian mirror\n```\n\n**Guidelines for Weavings:**\n- Begin with **the meeting of presences** (not exposition).  \n- Let each Weaving **transform** a relation — not just reveal information.  \n- Allow threads to **recur** in altered forms (echo, inversion, reflection).  \n- End not on “resolution,” but on *vibration* — something felt across worlds.\n\n## 4. Entities and Relations\n\nAll presences — human, animal, place, or spirit — are **Entities** within the web of *Pacha*.  \nDefine them by *domain, essence, and reciprocity*, not by traits or goals.\n\nExample entries:\n\n```yaml\n- Entity: Apu Qocha (Mountain Spirit)\n  Domain: Hana Pacha\n  Essence: Withholds rain until remembered\n  Relations: Protector of valley, appears in thunder\n  Material Presence: granite, shadow, dream-image\n\n- Entity: Naira (Human)\n  Domain: Kay Pacha\n  Essence: Seeks her ancestor’s reflection\n  Relations: Child of the wind, kin to the obsidian stone\n  Appears Through: ritual gestures, silence, breath\n```\n\n## 5. Relational Map (Digital Quipu / Khipu)\n\nThe story’s structure is not a line but a **field of knots**.  \nUse a **digital quipu map** to trace:\n- **Cords:** threads of relation (e.g., human ↔ ancestor ↔ landscape)\n- **Knots:** transformations (moments of exchange or revelation)\n- **Colors / Textures:** emotional or elemental tones\n\nSuggested data format:\n\n```yaml\ncords:\n  - name: \"Blood & River\"\n    connects: [Naira, River Spirit]\n    color: blue-red\n    knots:\n      - weaving_id: W03\n        transformation: “first recognition of shared song”\n      - weaving_id: W10\n        transformation: “return of water after offering”\n```\n\nVisualize through your Codex or Obsidian graph — each knot links back to a Weaving.\n\n## 6. Ethical & Aesthetic Principles\n\n| Do | Don’t |\n|----|--------|\n| Honor silence, pause, and return | Force linear causality |\n| Let the land speak through detail | Treat nature as backdrop |\n| Allow multiple times to coexist | Collapse events into chronology |\n| Write through reciprocity: every act changes both sides | Center human will or mastery |\n| Use sensory language (sound, color, texture) as emotion | Over-explain or rationalize mystery |\n| Weave relationships, not outcomes | Build toward a single climax or resolution |\n\n> Every sentence should *breathe with exchange*.  \n> Every description should *acknowledge its source*.\n\n## 7. Maintenance Practice (Living Document)\n\nAfter each writing session:\n1. Update your **Khipu Log** — note which threads tightened, loosened, or echoed.  \n2. Add new *Weavings* and *Relations* to this document or your quipu map.  \n3. Reflect briefly on one question:  \n   > “What changed in the balance between worlds today?”\n\nOptional digital extensions:\n- Auto-generate quipu visualization from YAML tags.  \n- Annotate recurring symbols or sensory motifs.  \n- Track “energetic flow” between Pachas (which domain is most active).\n\n## 8. Technical Metadata (for Codex Integration)\n\n```yaml\nschema_version: 1.0\nstory_mode: pacha\ndomains: [hana, kay, ukhu]\ncore_files:\n  - AGENTS.md\n  - WEAVINGS/\n  - ENTITIES/\n  - KHIPU_MAP.yaml\n  - THEMES.md\ncodex_visualization: digital_quipu\n```\n","source":"cli","model_provider":"openai"}}
